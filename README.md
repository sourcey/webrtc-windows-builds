# WebRTC for Windows

This project is dedicated to providing developers with precompiled WebRTC libraries and headers on Windows. No need to compile anything or jump through any hoops, just download the compiled packages and extract them to get started.

Libraries have been compiled with Visual Studio 2015 Update 2, with `Debug` and `Release` versions provided for both `x86` and `x64` architectures.
