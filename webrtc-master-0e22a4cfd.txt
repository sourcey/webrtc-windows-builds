    Android HW decoder: Support odd heights for non-texture output
    
    When textures are not enabled and we are using byte buffer outputs, the
    decoder is currently crashing for odd heights because of an RTC_CHECK.
    This CL removes the check and handles the pointer offset to the chroma
    planes for the odd height case instead.
    
    This has been verified to work correctly on a Pixel device.
